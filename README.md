# hakoniwa-ar-bridge
A bridge connecting AR applications with real-world positional and sensor data. This repository aligns AR devices with physical coordinates via the Hakoniwa simulation hub, enabling AR users to view real-world data in AR space and feed AR data back to reality, creating an interactive mixed-reality experience.
